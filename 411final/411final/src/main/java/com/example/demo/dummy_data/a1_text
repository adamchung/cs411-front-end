In his inauguration speech on January 20, 1961, President John F. Kennedy famously encouraged Americans to: “Ask not what your country can do for you—ask what you can do for your country.”

Apple (AAPL - Get Rating)

I’m paraphrasing JFK’s line to explain to you the right way to look at the Wall Street buzz surrounding Apple (AAPL) and 5G: while Wall Street is giving fanciful numbers on what 5G will do for sales of the iPhone from AAPL, I think we should ask not what 5G can do for Apple, but what Apple can do for the rollout of 5G.

The reality is that 5G infrastructure here in the U.S. is woefully behind many Asian countries, including China. The mobile telecoms industry group, GSMA, predicts that a third of the world’s population will be able to access 5G by 2025.

It is still a question, though, whether all United States mobile phone users will be among those numbers.

To coincide with the launch of the newest iPhones, Verizon CEO Hans Vestberg announced the company would initiate its 5G network in the U.S. on Tuesday, following rivals T-Mobile last December and AT&T over the summer.

However, Gene Munster at Loup Ventures estimated that Verizon’s advertised download speeds–up to four gigabits per second in ideal circumstances–would only be available to a mere 1% of the U.S. population at launch. Munster also projects that at best, that number may hit 25% in a year or two.
